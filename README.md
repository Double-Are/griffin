# griffin

A peer-to-peer document-oriented database. Take back ownership over your data!

Griffin is a decentralized database powered by [GUN](https://github.com/amark/gun) that implements an API and query language similar to MongoDB. All data stored is automatically encrypted and distributed over a peer-to-peer network and can optionally be shared with others. It is a truly powerful database solution.

## Usage

`yarn add griffin-browser` or `yarn add griffin-nodejs`

```js
import Griffin from "griffin-browser"

const griffin = Griffin()

await griffin.create("username", "password", {
	skynet: ..., // which skynet portal the user wants to use
}, false) // false means you do not require unique usernames

await griffin.auth("username", "password")

const db = griffin.namespace("my-app")
const app_specific_key = await db.gen() // This is an optional 12 word mnemonic generated by the user
await db.auth(app_specific_key)

const dogs = await db.collection("dogs")

await dogs.insert([
	{ name: "Gordon", color: "black", age: 3, owners: ["John", "Cindy"] },
	{ name: "Pooch", color: "brown", age: 5, owners: ["John", "Cindy"] },
	{ name: "Snuffles", color: "brown", age: 7, owners: ["Karen"] },
	...
]).many()

console.log(await dogs.find({ color: "brown" }).sort({ name: 1 }).one())
console.log(await dogs.find({ name: { $or: ["Gordon", "Pooch"] } }).fields({ _id: 0 }).many())
console.log(await dogs.find({ age: { $lt: 7, $gte: 3 } }).limit(10).many())

await dogs.update({ age: 5 }, { $inc: { age: 1 } }).one()
await dogs.replace({ name: "Gordon" }, { name: "Gordon Ramsey", color: "blonde", age: 54, owners: null })
```

## Contributing to the network

Griffin relays operate over a libp2p network to enable relay switching and limited single point of failure. Your relay will be used by random members of the entire Griffin network.

They are very simple to setup. S3 backed storage relays are a big plus.

```js
const Griffin = require("griffin-nodejs")

Griffin.server({
	s3: {
		key: "",
	    secret: "",
	    bucket: "",
	},
})
```

## Donations

Feel free to donate! I plan on implementing the entire MongoDB API, a file storage API based on Sia/Skynet and other features involving shared data.

I can work on this much more frequently with a more sustainable income. All donations will go to living expenses, assets, servers and Sia file storage costs (I plan on running my own Skynet portal).
