# griffin

A peer-to-peer document-oriented database. Take back ownership over your data!

Griffin is a decentralized database powered by [GUN](https://github.com/amark/gun) that implements MongoDB's query language. All data stored is automatically encrypted and distributed over a peer-to-peer network and can optionally be shared with others. It is a truly powerful database solution.

## Status

In very early development. I wouldn't recommend using it just yet.

## Usage

In the future: `yarn add griffin-browser` or `yarn add griffin-node`

For now, it is unreleased.

```js
import Griffin from "griffin-browser"

const griffin = Griffin()
await griffin.auth("username", "password")

const db = griffin.namespace("my-app")
const app_specific_key = await db.gen() // This is an optional 12 word mnemonic generated by the user
await db.auth(app_specific_key)

const dogs = await db.collection("dogs")
await dogs.insert([
	{ name: "Gordon", color: "black", owners: ["John", "Cindy"] },
	{ name: "Pooch", color: "brown", owners: ["John", "Cindy"] },
	{ name: "Snuffles", color: "brown", owners: ["Karen"] },
	...
]).many()
const brown = await dogs.find({ color: "brown" }).sort({ name: 1 }).limit(10).many()
console.log(brown)
```
