# griffin

A peer-to-peer document-oriented database. Take back ownership over your data!

Griffin is a decentralized database powered by [GUN](https://github.com/amark/gun) that implements MongoDB's query language. All data stored is automatically encrypted and distributed over a peer-to-peer network and can optionally be shared with others. It is a truly powerful database solution.

## Usage

```js
import Griffin from "griffin-browser"

const griffin = Griffin()
griffin.auth("username", "password")

const db = griffin.namespace("my-app")
db.auth("app-specific-key") // This is an optional key generated by the user
// If the user chooses to generate a key, it will be used for encryption instead of their universal private key

const todos = db.collection("todos")
const completed = await todos.find({ completed: true }).sort({ name: 1 }).limit(10)
console.log(completed)
```
